This is a new file!
TO get this up to the remote repository, I need to...

1. git add , OR git add -A or git add [filename] e.g. git add newFile.txt This will ensure that the file is TRACKED for changes.

2. git commit -m 'my commit message'
This captures a snapshot of the project's changes.

:wq to escape from Vim editor if you forget the message 

3. git push to merge my commits into the remote repository's history.
